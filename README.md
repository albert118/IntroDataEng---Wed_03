# Machine Learning - Stochastic Optimization

### IDEA:
*Utilise the PBIL algorithm (essentially a basic genetic algorithm in this case) to stochasticlly optimise the concentrator - terminal problem.*

### Background Reading
* Differences between Epoch, Batch and Mini-Batch: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/117919/what-are-the-differences-between-epoch-batch-and-minibatch
